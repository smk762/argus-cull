## Argus suite
<!-- argus-suite: keep this block; argus-ci checks for it -->
This repo is part of the Argus suite. The suite map below lists every sibling and what it owns; check it before
building something a sibling may already do. **On every release, update this repo's row and capabilities in
argus-cortex's SUITE.md** (a PR to argus-cortex in the same release).

## Branches

`dev` is the default branch and the base for every PR. Cut feature branches from `origin/dev` and bring them up to date by merging `origin/dev`, never `main`. Never open a PR against `main` or push work to it directly: `main` must never be ahead of `dev`. A release fast-forwards `main` to a `dev` commit that passed CI (`git push origin origin/dev:main`), then tags it. If `main` is protected and needs a PR, merge the release PR, then immediately merge `main` back into `dev` so the merge commit is not left on `main` alone.
